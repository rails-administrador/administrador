# Administrador

Yet another rails admin UI.

Why do we need another one?

Most admin UIs need to be hacked or bent to support engines. This admin UI thinks
engines first, main-app second. ;)

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'administrador'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install administrador
```

Run the rails generator:
```bash
$ rails g administrador:install
```

## Configuration

Look at the initializer at config/initializers/administrador.rb for configuration
options.

## Usage

Go to /en/backend and enjoy your admin UI.
